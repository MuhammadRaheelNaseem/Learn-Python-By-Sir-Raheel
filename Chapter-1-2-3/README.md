## `1. What is Python?`

1991 marked the birth of many amazing inventions, events, accomplishments, etc. One of the most important computer programming languages – Python – was built by Guido van Rossum in the very same year.

Many developers will think the programming language’s name was dubbed after the longest reptile in the world but actually, the word “Python” came from a British comedy series called “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”.

## `What is Python used for? `

Since it has so many advantages in comparison with other programming languages, Python programming is practiced in various big and small tech companies such as:

* Google, to operate the search engine and the video-sharing website YouTube. In fact, the founders of Google stated: “Python where we can, C++ where we must”.
* Mozilla, they have written more than 230,000 lines of code in Python.
* Microsoft, this company uses Python to develop its IDE and Visual Studio Code.
* Netflix, Python is applied in every product and experiment from data science to its regional failover monitoring software.
* Reddit, the 4th most used social networking site, uses Python to develop the entire website.

Comes to the world as a superhero that can resolve mostly everything regarding technology, the uses of Python just are not just a few listed above, instead, this versatile programming language also enables developers to:

* program CGI for web apps.
* work on data science.
* build RSS readers.
* read from and write to MySQL, PostgreSQL.
* develop various AI projects.
* program software and applications like Blender, Calibre, etc.
* read and modify files.

So, in short, you can use Python for mostly every idea that comes to your mind.

## `2. | 3. Uses of Python Programming Language / Python Applications?`

Python's versatility enables it to be used in a wide range of applications across various industries. Let's take a look at some of the ways Python is used.

`Data scientists and analysts:`
Data science is one of the most popular uses for Python. Data scientists use programming languages like Python and R to manipulate data for reporting, predictive analysis, and more. Python's simple syntax and extensive selection of third-party libraries make it a great choice for anyone considering a career in data science.

`Machine learning:`
Machine learning involves training systems to learn independently by using algorithms that constantly update themselves based on input data. These systems gradually learn to handle new situations by generating an output based on past datasets. Then, based on the outcome of this new situation, they update themselves to deal with new variables, thus constantly evolving.

`Web development:`
Python is also widely used for back-end development, where it runs in the server of web applications and interacts with databases and APIs after a user requests data from the app's front-end in the browser.
Much of Python's popularity in web development stems from frameworks and libraries like Django and Flask that extend the language's utility.

`Scripting and utility software:`
Many of the tools and software built into Linux operating systems are written in Python. Python started as a language for writing utility scripts, and it's still widely used for this purpose. 

## `4. Python for Networking`

Python provides two levels of access to network programming. These are – 

`Low-Level Access:`
At the low level, you can access the basic socket support of the operating system. You can implement client and server for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

`High-Level Access:` At the high level allows to implement protocols like HTTP, FTP, etc.

## `5. Python for Automated Testing`

Python already comes with a set of tools and libraries to help you create automated tests for your application. Automated testing is the execution of your test plan (the parts of your application you want to test, the order in which you want them to be tested, and the expected responses) by a script instead of a human.

## `6. Features of Python Programming Language`

There are many features in Python, some of which are discussed below as follows:

`1. Easy to code:` Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in python language and anybody can learn python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language. 

`2. Free and Open Source: `Python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the given download link below click on the Download Python keyword. Download Python Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it as, use it as well as share it. 

`3. Object-Oriented Language:` One of the key features of python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, objects encapsulation, etc. 

`4. GUI Programming Support:` Graphical User interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython, or Tk in python. PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.

`5. High-Level Language:` Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory.

`6. Extensible feature:` Python is a Extensible language. We can write some Python code into C or C++ language and also we can compile that code in C/C++ language.

`7. Python is Portable language:` Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have python code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.

`8. Python is Integrated language:` Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrated python with other languages like c, c++, etc. 

`9. Interpreted Language:` Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java, etc. there is no need to compile python code this makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.

`10. Large Standard Library:` Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.

`11. Dynamically Typed Language:` Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example- int, double, long, etc.) for a variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we don’t need to specify the type of variable.

`12. Frontend and backend development:` With a new project pyscript you can run and write python codes in html with the help of some simple tags  etc. This will help you do frontend development work in python like javascript. Backend is the strong forte of python it’s extensively used for this work cause of its framework like django and flask.

## `7. Implementations of Python & its career opportunities`

There's a high demand for Python developers in world wide but the supply is really, really low. This is what makes it a great opportunity for Pakistanis to get skilled in python. One of Pakistan's software companies faced a dilemma after winning a $200 million (Rs. 1200 crore) contract with a large US bank. Instead, they hired a group of freelance Python programmers in the US instead.
